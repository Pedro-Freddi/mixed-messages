# Mixed Messages

This project is part of **Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Path's** portfolio projects.

The objective was to build a javascipt terminal application that generates a random message output when run.

I chose the theme of Zen messages that transmit inspiration, peace and contemplation topics for a random day of the week.

## Technologies

- Node.js *version 16.13.2*
- Git *version 2.35.1.windows.2*

## Requirements

The application is very simple. The only requirement is to have Node.js installed on your machine.

## How to run it

1. Open the *Command Line Interface (CLI)* and clone this repository with the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Pedro-Freddi/mixed-messages.git
```

2. In the terminal, navigate to the mixed-messages directory and run the application with the command:
```
node script.js
```
3. The message will then be outputted. Here's an example:
```
Next wednesday will be a sublime day! A great opportunity to contemplate on karma.
```
